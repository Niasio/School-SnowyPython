# School-SnowyPython
> 1st year project of DUT Network &amp; Telecommunication, made in Python. It aims to represent a maze with doors and clues. We have to get out of it to win.

## Installation

Simply open main.py and run the program
```

## Usage example

It is a maze, so it is a small game embedded in a python launcher

## Release History
